Understand the Raw Data the Agency Takes In [...] A natural way for agencies to help end users understand data is to use geographic-based visualizations, since so much of agency work is based on location. When using geographic visualizations, however, it is important to use clear, precise geocoding. For example, if data was coded only to the state level, then users shouldn’t be able to zoom in to a more specific level that implies greater precision. [...] 3. Turn to Data Scientists and Use Accurate Stats\\n\\nFor a simple dashboard with time-based data on a graph, there are no statistics involved.

The [Poultry Industry Council](https://www.poultryindustrycouncil.ca/downloads/kpi-2.pdf) provides a comprehensive list of KPIs, such as feed conversion ratio (FCR), average growth period, mortality rates, and average weight gain for broilers.\\n   - From [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-six-top-key-performance-indicators-poultry-business-jeremy-watson), feed conversion, daily gain, and mortality are crucial KPIs for broiler farms.\\n   - Industry standards involve a blend of genetic, nutritional, and environmental factors influencing performance ([Poultry World](https://www.poultryworld.net/the-industrymarkets/processing/part-1-key-performance-indicators-for-poultry-processing/)).\\n\\n2. **Chicken Mortality Rates**:\\n   - According to [WATTAgNet](https://www.wattagnet.com/broilers-turkeys/broilers/article/15534464/how-to-control-early-chick-mortality-in-the-broiler-house), acceptable chicken mortality rates range from 1% to 5% within a 45-day production cycle.\\n   - The [Vencomatic Group](https://www.vencomaticgroup.com/blog/broiler-mortality-contributing-factors-and-how-to-reduce-it) suggests that maintaining mortality below 1% after the first week is considered efficient.\\n\\n3. **Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR)**:\\n   - As per [Alltech](https://www.alltech.com/blog/how-do-you-measure-performance-poultry-industry), a typical FCR for broilers is around 1.6, meaning for every 1.6 kilograms of feed consumed, 1 kilogram of weight is gained.\\n   - According to [Feedia by TECHNA](https://www.groupe-techna.com/en/feedia/advice/feed-conversion-ratio-fcr-feed-cost-broiler-turkey), FCR is a crucial determinant of production costs and profitability.\\n\\n4. **Average Weight Gain Standards for Broilers**:\\n   - It is reported by [Phoenix Agribiz](https://www.phoenixagribiz.com.ng/2024/12/broiler-feeding-chart-and-weight-chart.html) that broilers can reach a target weight of 2.2-2.5 kg within 42 days, with an FCR of 1.25 to 1.82, depending on the phase and nutritional management.\\n   - [Munters](https://www.munters.com/en-us/industries/food-and-agriculture/poultry/broilers/weight-management/) indicates an average daily weight gain for broilers of 80-90 grams.\\n\\n5. **Data Retrieval Best Practices**:\\n   - According to [Planeks](https://www.planeks.net/bi-dashboard-best-practices/), it is crucial to implement optimization techniques like data aggregation and caching to ensure dashboards load quickly and perform efficiently.\\n   - [DashboardFox](https://dashboardfox.com/blog/dashboardfox-guide-best-practices-for-handling-large-data-sets/) emphasizes structuring data into SQL views and optimizing database configurations to improve data retrieval time and accuracy.\\n\\nBy aligning these practices and standards with the poultry data dashboard, the company can benchmark its performance effectively and improve operational efficiencies.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, name='researcher', id='55eed939-0008-41c3-bc55-3a95212decf2'), AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_qlDgToR9zgP0bkWipsJRTG9n', 'function': {'arguments': '{\"metrics\":[{\"name\":\"Chicken Mortality Rate\",\"value\":\"1-5%\",\"industry_benchmark\":\"<5%\",\"description\":\"Tracking the percentage of chicken deaths over a specific period.\"},{\"name\":\"Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR)\",\"value\":\"~1.6\",\"industry_benchmark\":\"1.5 to 1.7\",\"description\":\"Measuring the feed conversion ratio which is the amount of feed required to gain a unit of weight.\"},{\"name\":\"Weight Gain\",\"value\":\"65-90 grams/day\",\"description\":\"Average weight gain of chickens over a specified time period.\",\"industry_benchmark\":\"80-90 grams/day\"},{\"name\":\"Data Retrieval and Loading Times\",\"description\":\"Measure the latency in fetching data from the API for operational efficiency.\",\"best_practice\":\"Implement data aggregation and caching strategies.\"},{\"name\":\"Error Rate in Data Fetching\",\"description\":\"Frequency and types of errors encountered during data fetch operations.\",\"best_practice\":\"Track and reduce error frequency through robust data handling techniques.\"}]}', 'name': 'validate_business_metrics'}, 'type': 'function'}], 'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 214, 'prompt_tokens': 9036, 'total_tokens': 9250, 'completion_tokens_details': {'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'cached_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_6ec83003ad', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BEiWOD37k4OfJM5HPYzyFnUAVGtMf', 'finish_reason': 'tool_calls', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-8578ec05-690f-42ce-b5de-79e5c31ff655-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'validate_business_metrics', 'args': {'metrics': [{'name': 'Chicken Mortality Rate', 'value': '1-5%', 'industry_benchmark': '<5%', 'description': 'Tracking the percentage of chicken deaths over a specific period.'}, {'name': 'Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR)', 'value': '~1.6', 'industry_benchmark': '1.5 to 1.7', 'description': 'Measuring the feed conversion ratio which is the amount of feed required to gain a unit of weight.'}, {'name': 'Weight Gain', 'value': '65-90 grams/day', 'description': 'Average weight gain of chickens over a specified time period.', 'industry_benchmark': '80-90 grams/day'}, {'name': 'Data Retrieval and Loading Times', 'description': 'Measure the latency in fetching data from the API for operational efficiency.', 'best_practice': 'Implement data aggregation and caching strategies.'}, {'name': 'Error Rate in Data Fetching', 'description': 'Frequency and types of errors encountered during data fetch operations.', 'best_practice': 'Track and reduce error frequency through robust data handling techniques.'}]}, 'id': 'call_qlDgToR9zgP0bkWipsJRTG9n', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 9036, 'output_tokens': 214, 'total_tokens': 9250, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), ToolMessage(content=[], name='validate_business_metrics', id='6107f39f-86d8-4653-ac6c-73b409d1f9c8', tool_call_id='call_qlDgToR9zgP0bkWipsJRTG9n'), HumanMessage(content='Here is a structured analysis of the poultry farm dashboard metrics against industry standards and best practices:\\n\\n1. **Chicken Mortality Rate**\\n   -

For dairy cows, for example, the output is milk, whereas in animals raised for meat (such as beef cows,[1] pigs, chickens, and fish) the output is the flesh, that is, the body mass gained by the animal, represented either in the final mass of the animal or the mass of the dressed output.  FCR is [...] As of 2013[update] in the US, an FCR calculated on live weight gain of 4.5–7.5 was in the normal range with an FCR above 6 being typical.[8] Divided by an average carcass yield of 62.2%, the typical carcass weight FCR is above 10. As of 2013[update] FCRs had not changed much compared to other fields in the prior 30 years, especially compared to poultry which had improved feed efficiency by about 250% over the last 50 years.[8]\\n\\nDairy cattle', 'score': 0.69672287, 'raw_content': None}, {'url': 'https://www.navfarm.com/blog/fcr-guide/', 'title': 'The Ultimate Guide to FCR (Feed Conversion Ratio) - Navfarm Blog', 'content': 'NavFarm\\n\\nThe Ultimate Guide to FCR (Feed Conversion Ratio)\\n\\nFeed Conversion Ratio or FCR is one of the most critical components of livestock management. Each poultry farm owner or livestock manager wants to have low FCR. Each farm owner involved in animal husbandry uses FCR to define the feeding strategy or analyze feed efficiency. Here in this post, we will discuss everything about FCR, including how to achieve the best FCR in livestock.\\n\\nTake a look…..\\n\\nWhat is Feed Conversion Ratio or FCR? [...] Feed conversion ratio or FCR is a measure of an animal’s efficiency to convert feed into increased body mass. It indicates how efficient an animal is to convert feed mass to the desired output. The expected outcome may be anything, from milk for dairy cows and goats, eggs for laying birds, meat for meat animals such as broilers, goats, pigs, etc., wool for wool animals like sheep, goats, rabbits, etc. An FCR helps farmers to determine whether or not an animal is an efficient food converter. In [...] Follow these tips and achieve the best FCR in livestock. Feed conversion ratio or FCR is an excellent tool to measure the feed intake per unit output. The lower the FCR, the better the performance of your farm. Animals with lower FCR are considered best, as they convert feed to output efficiently. The simplest way to reduce the cost of production is lower FCRs. It would help if you always targeted lower FCRs to increase productivity at your farm.
